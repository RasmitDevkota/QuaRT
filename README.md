# QuaRT - Quantum Radiation Transport

An exploration of quantum methods for radiation transport, particularly for astrophysical and cosmological problems.

# Installation

QuaRT currently operates directly through its source code in Python (there is no `pip` package at the moment).

# Simulators

QuaRT currently features a quantum lattice Boltzmann solver which uses angular redistribution.
